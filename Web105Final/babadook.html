            <h2>About The Movie</h2>
            <p><em>The Babadook</em> is a psychological horror movie that was released Januray 17, 2014. The movie focuses  on Amelia and her son Sam. Amelia is suffering from great depression and anxiety after her husband was killed in a car accident on their way to give birth to Sam. One night Sam asks his mom to read him a pop up book called, Mister Babadook. The book starts out sweet, but soon reveals its sinister intentions. Shortly after Mister Babadook begins to visit Amelia and Sam in their home, as Amerlia struggles to keep her sanity and trying to learn what's real and what isn't. </p>
            
            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This movie came out in a time where I was begining to believe scary horror films were disapearing. This horror came out to prove that I was wrong. One thing that I want to make clear is that this isn't a traditional monster attacks people movie. So if you were expecting Mister Babadook to come in slashing people apart you might be dissapointed. This movie plays with your emotions and mind. And gives you an uncomfortable feeling of dread as the movie continues. By the end of the film I was feeling exhausted just like the main characters. I know this summary has been vague, but I'd hate to give away too much plot points. </p>
              
              <blockquote>Baba-DOOK-DOOK-DOOK</blockquote>
            <p>This phrase would echo through any scene where the Babadook would appear. Sounds silly, and it is, but it really sets up a freaky vibe. I definitely recommend seeing this if you're a fan of horror.</p>
