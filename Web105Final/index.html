            <h2>About The Movie</h2>
            <p><em>Halloween</em> is a slasher horror movie that was released October 25, 1978.The movie centers around Laurie Strode, a typical teenager living in Haddonfield Illinois. On the day of Halloween Laurie is stalked by a masked man named Michael Myers, a dangerous psychopath who has escaped his imprisonment. Michael's child psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis, has also arrived in Haddonfield to warn those of how dangerous Michael is, and to stop him himself. As the night goes on, Michael Myers gets closer and closer towards Laurie, leading up to their final confrontation.</p>

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p><em>Halloween</em> is one the most classic slasher films to this day, and I'd say is responsable for bringing the slasher genre into the mainstream. This movie does a great job in building up tension and suspension, creating anticipation for when Michael Myers will strike next. Another thing that makes this movie so great for me is Dr. Loomis' character. Donald Pleasence does a great job in bringing this character to life, especially when he's explaining stuff about Michael and why he's so dangerous. One of my favorite quotes from Loomis is a conversion he's having with the Sherrif over a dog that someone tried to eat.

            <blockquote>Loomis: This isn't a man.</blockquote>
            <p>Chilling. They don't dive too deep into Michael's backstory, but this small piece of dialogue gives you everything you need to know. Overall I definitely recommend seeing this classic, if you haven't already.</p>
