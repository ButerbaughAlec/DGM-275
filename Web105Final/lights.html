            <h2>About The Movie</h2>
            <p><em>Lights Out</em> is a supernatural horror movie that was released July 22, 2016. The movie focuses on a family who are haunted by a supernatural entity that only appears in the dark.  </p>
            
            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This is a pretty straightforward movie. Ghost haunts family, family deny ghost presence, family finally confront ghost. But this one actually surprised me with how well it was done. The monster in this film, named Diane, is genuinely creepy. The opening scene where the woman is turning the lights on and off as this shadowy figure moves closer and closer was very well done. And surprisingly the overall story and characters put into this movie were good as well. This movie kind of flew under my radar when it first came out, I didn't see much buzz about it, and didn't see much advertising for it, so going into this movie I didn't know what to expect. But by modern horror movie standards, this gets a thumbs up from me. It's not amazing or anything, but I think it's still worth mentioning and seeing.   </p>

            <p>Haven't seen much buzz or talk about this movie, and I think that's a shame. It's no masterpiece by any means, but I still think it's worth a watch for any horror fan. See what you think of it.</p>
