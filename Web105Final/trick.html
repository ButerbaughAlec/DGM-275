            <h2>About The Movie</h2>
            <p><em>Trick 'r Treat</em> is an anthology horror movie that was released December 9, 2007. The movie focuses on several different stories, all happening at the same time on Halloween night. Each story revolving around some horrible event, all relating to a small boy in pajamas who wears a sack over his head named, Sam.  </p>
            
            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>If you're unfamliar with the creator of this movie, you might remember his most recent work, Krampus. Both movies share a similar vibe. I've always liked anthology stories, the thought of reading or seeing multiple stories play out that all connect together in some way has always appealed to me. To give away the stories and twists in this movie would be an injustice. Really you should see it for yourself. One thing that I noticed when I first heard of this movie is that there aren't many Halloween related horror movies. Sure there are horror movies that take place on Halloween, but no horror movies that tie directly into the dark past of Halloween and its roots. The mascot of this movie, Sam, sure is a joy to watch. I could see him being a mascot of some sort for the holiday. Basically without spoiling too much about Sam, he's some sort of a spirit of Halloween. He wanders around on Halloween making sure people are properly following the tradition. And if you aren't... then well...</p>

            <p>If you're in the mood for something Halloweeney (That's a word... right?) then I'd say this movie is worth your time.</p>
